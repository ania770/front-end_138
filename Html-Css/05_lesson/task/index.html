                <h3 class="text">What is Egg Car Racing?</h3>
                <p class="text">Egg Car Racing combines the fun of racing with the challenge of keeping a delicate egg
                    unbroken. Your job is to drive a wobbly car with an egg onboard through rough roads, making sure it
                    doesn't crack. Every bump and obstacle presents a new challenge, requiring careful acceleration,
                    braking, and jumping. Unlock Eggy Cars as you progress, and try your best to protect the egg at all
                    costs! Let's get to the grips now.</p>
